# Text to Speech using React, Express, and the OpenAI API

## This project is built using:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)

This is a small project that uses OpenAI's API to convert typed text into audio spoken by OpenAI's Alloy. 

Below is a gif of how this mini app works!
